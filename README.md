☀️ 2MW Solar Performance & Wind-Cooling Dashboard
An interactive dashboard to analyze the efficiency and thermal health of a 2MW Solar Power Plant using high-resolution sensor data.

📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes how weather conditions—specifically Wind Speed—impact solar panel temperature and overall power generation.

🔬 Key Analysis Studies
Wind-Cooling Effect: How wind acts as a natural coolant for the panels.

Efficiency vs. Temp: Measuring power loss for every degree of heat.

3-Phase Load Balance: Checking if the electrical load is balanced across the grid.

Solar Power Curve: Mapping Irradiance (sunlight) against AC Power output.

Thermal Regression: Predicting panel temperature based on weather inputs.

DC/AC Conversion: Monitoring inverter performance and conversion health.

🛠️ Tech Stack
